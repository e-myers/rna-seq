Description: An analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data.  This includes trimming (with cutadapt), mapping (with STAR), and getting read counts (with featureCounts).  This package includes functions for converting between file formats such as bed, bedgraph, and bigwig, for converting raw counts to TPM, and for writing gene-by-sample expression matrices to csv files. 
    Expression values, mean expression, and log2 fold change may be plotted with heatmaps.
